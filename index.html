Jupiter is the fifth and largest planet in the solar system.
More than twice as massive as all the other planets combined; it is almost 318 times more massive than Earth.
 However, Jupiter's mass is insufficient to become a Sun-like star:
 for this reason, its mass should be 70-80 times greater.
The planet was known to people from ancient times, which is reflected in the mythology and religious beliefs
 of different cultures: Mesopotamian, Babylonian, Greek and others.
 The modern name of Jupiter comes from the name of the ancient Roman supreme god-thunder. </p>

A number of atmospheric phenomena on Jupiter - such as storms, lightnings, auroras -
have scales that are far superior to earthly ones.
 A notable formation in the atmosphere is the Great Red Spot - a giant storm known since the seventeenth century.
 Jupiter has 79 satellites, the largest of which - Io, Europe, Ganymede and Callisto - were discovered in 1610.
  The last 12 were only opened in 2018 [3]. Jupiter studies are carried out with the help of terrestrial and orbital telescopes,
   since the 1970s,
 8 NASA interplanetary vehicles were sent to the planet: "Pioneers", "Voyagers", "Galileo" and others.</p>
